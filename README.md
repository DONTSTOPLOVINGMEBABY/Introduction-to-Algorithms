# Introduction-to-Algorithms
## *Thomas H Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein*

This repository houses my notes and solutions for the lessons/exercises contained in the popular book *Introduction to Algorithms*. I will first divide  the repository up by the main sections of the book (I - VII) which will be further divided up by the specific chapter for each section. By completing these exercises, I hope to strengthen my intution for various algorithms commonly used in computer science and learn how their implementations vary across different languages.
