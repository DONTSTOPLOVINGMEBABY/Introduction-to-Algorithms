# Introduction-to-Algorithms
## *Thomas H Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein*

This repository houses my notes and solutions for the lessons/exercises contained in the popular book *Introduction to Algorithms*. The repository will be divided by book chapters. By completing these exercises, I hope to strengthen my intution for various algorithms commonly used in computer science and learn how their implementations vary across different languages.
