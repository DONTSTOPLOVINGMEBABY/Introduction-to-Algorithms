'''
An array A[1 : n] that represents a heap is an object with an attribute A.heap-size, 
which represents how many elements in the heap are stored with an array A. That is, 
although A[1:N] may contain numbers, only the elements in A[1:A.heap-size], where 0 ≤
A.heap-size ≤ n, are valid elements of the heap. If A.heap-size = 0, then the heap is empty. The 
root of the tree is A[1], and given the index i of a node, there is a way to compute the indices of its parent,
left-child, and right-child with one-line procedures.
